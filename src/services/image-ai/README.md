# Image AI Service (Scaffolding)

Mocked image enhancement service for the host listing flow. This layer is where
we will later add real providers, adaptive rendering profiles, and async job
status updates.

Planned responsibilities:
- enhancement profiles (lighting, dusk, declutter)
- async job tracking and progress hooks
- storage of original vs enhanced assets
- audit trail events for compliance
